# bikeshareviz
This Shiny app uses historical Capital Bikeshare ridership to visualize inflows and outflows from each station. Future work might include expanding the dataset to allow for network changes over time and creating a webscraping app that allows riders to visualize and customize their personal Bikeshare usage.
